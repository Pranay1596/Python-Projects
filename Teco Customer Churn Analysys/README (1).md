# Teco Customer Churn Analysys
 Objective: 
 The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing on various factors such as payment
 methods, contract types, tenure, and demographic attributes.
 The goal is to identify which factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer retention
 strategies.

Key insights and findings:

Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn (42%), while long-term contracts (one-year: 11%, two-year: 3%) are highly effective for customer retention.

Payment Method: Customers using electronic checks are most likely to churn (45%), suggesting a need to encourage more stable payment options like credit cards or bank transfers.

Customer Tenure: The first year is the most critical period, with a 50% churn rate. Churn decreases significantly as customer tenure increases.

Internet Service: Fiber Optic customers have a higher churn rate (30%) than DSL users (20%), which may indicate service quality or competition issues.

Demographics: Senior citizens have a notably higher churn rate (41%) compared to non-senior citizens (26%), suggesting they require targeted retention efforts.
